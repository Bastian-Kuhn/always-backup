===================
Currently there are only Modules for Evernote and Dropbox.
Also it's only possible to sync from remote to local.

Later there will be also Facebook, Google+ etc. modules. 
The system (also later) will support sync between multipe modules of same type. 
This means you can sync Evernote to Evernote or Dropbox to Evernote, 
Dropox to Dropbox...

Some of the todo's:
 - Web Interface Access to Evernote Files
 - Trash function for files
